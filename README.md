# Method & Mission
- I believe pitch and chord matching and recognition is at the core of being a creative and expressive musician.
- The goal of this app is to quiz a musician on basic musical pitch and chord matching with quick feedback so that the feeling of a sound can directly be tied to a position for a musicians hands on the keyboard.
