# JustIntonation

Train your ear to recognize and play what you hear on the piano.

## Overview

JustIntonation is a piano based ear training application that helps musicians develop relative pitch on piano. By practicing in the context of a musical center (tonal reference), you'll develop the ability to identify scale degrees.  With dedication, and the combination of interval, quality and scale degree recognition you can learn how to directly translate these aspects to the piano in real time.

## Why JustIntonation?

Scale Degree, Melodic and Chord recognition form the foundation of creative, expressive musicianship. This app focuses on:

- **Accurate relative pitch recognition**: Learn to hear and identify notes, chords, and melodies with precision.
- **Direct muscle memory**: Connect what you hear directly to finger positions on your keyboard
- **Musical context**: Practice within different keys, scales, and harmonic contexts
- **Progressive learning**: Start with individual notes, advance to melodies and then chords

## Three Learning Modes

- **🎵 Notes**: Build your foundation by identifying individual notes in different keys and ranges
- **🎶 Melodies**: Master melodic sequences and develop the ability to follow longer musical phrases
- **🎼 Chords**: Challenge yourself with chord recognition and harmonic understanding
