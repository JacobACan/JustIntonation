# Method & Mission
- Musicians learn to match pitch internally by guessing and checking with their voice and recieving quick feedback.
- The ability to internalize the feeling of a note relative to a key center is possible and this app helps internalize that feeling, recognize the degree and directly attach a feeling to playing a note on the piano.
- The goal is to quiz a musician on basic musical matching with quick feedback so that the instrument becomes part of them, like the voice is, so that they can be more creative and express themselves fully.
