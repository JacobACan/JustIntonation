# Dos and Don'ts

- Dont execute/code anything unless there is a plan
- Always make descriptions more professional and easy to understand
- Use as few useState variables as possible
- Don't return unecessary information from functions that will never have an actual purpose in the app
- Go back through the entire code base to reduce coding bloat after each phase
